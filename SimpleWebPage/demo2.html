Instead of hoping to get noticed by scouts at events, players can create profiles by entering their own stats and specialities, uploading video and providing academic information. And it's free both for the players and anyone looking for fresh talent. \n\nOf course, it all has to get backed up on the court eventually, but the digital space can be a good starting point, the site's founders believe. \n\n\"We see it as a double-sided market, creating easy ways for both players and coaches to find each other,\" Cannon says. \n\nCannon and Brown met while working for the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers, and both have deep basketball backgrounds. Brown coached high school ball in Charlotte, while Cannon played at Morehouse College and then professionally for five years overseas. \n\nThey've been working on Ballers Bridge full-time for just over a year now, and got their company into the Stanford-affiliated StartX startup accelerator last year. With next to no publicity, they say more than 2,000 players and \"several hundred\" coaches from different levels have already signed up for the service, while they hope to make a full-scale launch this weekend during the litany of high-profile summer tournaments happening in Las Vegas. \n\nA seed round of funding raised about $200,000 for the company, and the founders plan to raise a larger round this fall. Monetization plans remain hazy, but one possibility includes eventually expanding the site to serve pro teams and players overseas. Advisors include Alan Stein, creator of an immensely popular series of YouTube videos on how young players can get better. \n\nBut, however they end up trying to make a living off the site longterm, both Brown and Cannon feel Ballers Bridge fills a niche they're uniquely qualified to fill. \n\n\"We see it as not just a traditional recruiting site,\" Brown says. \"It's something that's needed and we feel we can do more for kids than what's currently available. It's made for current players by people who played the game.\"\n\nImage: Stuart Seeger"},"shares":{"total":0},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzU5L0Jhc2tldGJhbGxTLjFkODkwLnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/5872bae8/e13/BasketballSunset.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzU5L0Jhc2tldGJhbGxTLjFkODkwLnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/b2cf7a9e/e13/BasketballSunset.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzU5L0Jhc2tldGJhbGxTLjFkODkwLnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/cc409aba/e13/BasketballSunset.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzU5L0Jhc2tldGJhbGxTLjFkODkwLnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/c5df9963/e13/BasketballSunset.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/16iWTnX","shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2013/05/02/basketball-time-machine/"}]},"excerpt":"A startup called Ballers Bridge looks to connect ambitious high school basketball players with scouts and coaches.

She will be one of three board members at the company and perhaps even contribute content. \n\nJobs isn't the only notable one backing the company -- Google's chief legal officer David Drummond and angel investor Ron Conway are also involved. But Jobs' involvement certainly lends the startup that much more prestige.\n\nOzy Media was founded by Carlos Watson, a former MSNBC anchor who took a job at Goldman Sachs after his show was cancelled. Watson tells Fortune that the new site will curate a select few stories each day and cater to the \"change generation,\" which he describes as \"a group that won\u2019t just tolerate things that are different but embrace things that are different.\u201d\n\nWatson has made a similar pitch before. In mid-2009, Watson launched The Stimulist, a news site that published and curated positive and inspiring stories for readers. And not just any readers: In interviews at the time, he said the website specifically catered to -- you guessed it -- \"the change generation.\" \n\nAs it so happens, I interned at The Stimulist for several months, though I never interacted with Watson directly. Each day, the website published six original stories, including one profile of a new face that people should know, one idea to spark a conversation and one blog post from Watson.\n\nWatson received funding for the The Stimulist from Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners and used his position as a television anchor to draw attention to the website. The Stimulist frequently ran articles picked up by major news outlets like The Daily Beast and The Huffington Post -- no small feat for a new website -- but Watson struggled to balance the website with his up-and-coming television career and ultimately shut it down later that year. \n\nThough Ozy Media isn't live yet, Fortune's descriptions suggest that it will borrow some aspects from The Stimulist, including focusing on publishing just a few short stories each day and emphasizing the images on the page. Several of the website's sections sound nearly identical to his previous media property as well: There will be profiles of up-and-comers, historical flashbacks and even a section called \"Good Sh*t,\" which also ran on The Stimulist.\n\nThe biggest difference appears to be Watson's larger team of journalists to work on Ozy Media and his plans to focus more on holding live events tied to the website.\n\nImage: Bloomberg via Getty Images"},"shares":{"facebook":28,"twitter":394,"google_plus":2,"linked_in":1,"total":425},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2L2U1L0xhdXJlbmVQb3dlLjM3YWM1LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/29e85b2f/f16/Laurene-Powell.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2L2U1L0xhdXJlbmVQb3dlLjM3YWM1LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/d9345758/f16/Laurene-Powell.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2L2U1L0xhdXJlbmVQb3dlLjM3YWM1LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/25c92e2a/f16/Laurene-Powell.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2L2U1L0xhdXJlbmVQb3dlLjM3YWM1LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/65ae2941/f16/Laurene-Powell.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/13a5A5M","shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Laurene Powell Jobs has backed a soon-to-launch media startup founded by a former MSNBC anchor.

According to the draft solicitation, there would be two such flights per year, once NASA places its first task order for a crewed flight.\n\nSEE ALSO: Now Boarding: The Top 10 Private Spaceships\n\nBefore NASA releases the final solicitation this fall, the agency will host a pre-solicitation conference with industry at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Aug. 1 and 2, according to the draft. As expected, the contract will be a fixed-priced deal administered under the Federal Acquisition Regulations. So far, NASA has mostly relied on funded Space Act Agreements to subsidize development of commercially designed spacecraft.\n\nWhile the competition is nominally free and open, it is generally believed that the companies with the best chance are those NASA is already funding as part of the third round of the Commercial Crew Program: Boeing Space Exploration Systems, Houston; Sierra Nevada Corp.'s Space Systems of Louisville, Colo.; and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) of Hawthorne, Calif.\n\nSEE ALSO: Building the International Space Station\n\nBoeing and SpaceX are working on capsules, while Sierra Nevada has a lifting-body design.

They were easy enough to ignore and made for interesting small talk.\n\nWhen they ordered two large pizzas and more than three different magazines to my parent's home, I got little more annoyed. The jokes were jumping offline and landing on my doorstep.\n\nThen they finally tracked down my cellphone number Monday and left me this voicemail.\n\nThis is what comes with reporting on the 4chan's most notorious community, /b/ -- a pornographic pit of obscenities, controversial pranks and violent photos. It's nothing new. As Cole Stryker, author of Epic Win for Anonymous: How 4chan's Army Conquered the Web, told me last year, he \"received pizzas and death threats, the usual.\"\n\nMy stories on a seemingly random 39-year-old named Charles, however, pissed /b/ off like never before.\n\nCharles's saga started on the night of July 15. The prank began like most others, with a call to action: to help Charles crush the dreams of \"teeny boppers\" by manipulating a Kiss 108 FM contest to meet Taylor Swift.\n\nImage: /b/, 4chan\n\nIn less than 24 hours, Charles had captured the top spot. In celebration, one /b/ user created the following tribute video, which has since collected more than 13,000 views.\n\nWhile /b/ enjoyed its success, I received the following emails from 4chan users supposedly named Alex Kapelanski, Anthony Bacher, and Joe Ratajzcak, accusing me of having sexual fantasies about Taylor Swift, of being a \"fucking f****t\" and of having no fun in high school. Most of them warned me about an imminent \"shitstorm.\"\n\nImage: /b/, 4chan\n\nAs has been the case with nearly all of /b/'s most recent pranks, Charles's failed. By the weekend, Boston's Kiss 108 FM had caught on to /b/'s ways and shut the contest down. The forum launched a Twitter hashtag #justice4charles, while a Facebook page under the same name collected 1,240 likes, And a Change.org petition garnered 196 votes from people calling for Kiss 108 FM to reverse its decision.\n\nOn Sunday, my father pix-messaged me the latest magazine he had \"accidentally\" received in the mail.\n\nImage: Fernando Alfonso III\n\nObviously, /b/ wasn't finished. On Monday, the community rallied behind Charles once again to help him win a chance to meet singer Selena Gomez. The contest was being hosted by Kiss 108 FM's sister station Z100. A few hours after publishing our story that morning, Z100 closed the contest early -- with Charles sitting in sixth place.\n\nImage: Z100\n\nThen the phone calls started pouring in.\n\nThey came from area codes in Alabama, California and New York. None of the callers left a voicemail except for the one above, which was made using a Pennsylvania number. One member of /b/ also started a Twitter account @rueryuzaki11 (which has since been suspended) and began spamming The Daily Dot with horrific images and violent threats.\n\nLooking back now on all the various forms of backlash my 4chan stories have created, there's one thing that separates the Charles saga from the rest: the human connection. Since September, /b/ has set its sights on corporations and celebrities -- all of which the community has little to no personal connection to. Charles is different. He's real.\n\nSince /b/ began its crusade to have Charles meet Gomez, Swift and the Jonas Brothers, he has been tweeting away, going along with the fun.\r\nWe are winning this battle. We are winning this war. We are winning this REVOLUTION. #Charles2013\u2014 Charles Z. (@cgz79) July 18, 2013\n\nChances are, Charles, or whoever hides behind his avatar, will never escape his presumed life of mediocrity or make A-list friends. But that doesn't matter. For almost two weeks, Charles was the most talked-about man on one of the top 900 most-visited sites online. And they've given him the best sort of friends a person can have -- the kind willing to kick a hornet's nest on your behalf.\n\nImage: Fernando Alfonso III"},"shares":{"facebook":46,"linked_in":4,"twitter":493,"total":543},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI1L2Y4LzRjaGFudm9pY2VtLjM0NWYyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/c6372a9f/a89/4chan-voicemail.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI1L2Y4LzRjaGFudm9pY2VtLjM0NWYyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/823644d2/a89/4chan-voicemail.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI1L2Y4LzRjaGFudm9pY2VtLjM0NWYyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/a25292fd/a89/4chan-voicemail.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI1L2Y4LzRjaGFudm9pY2VtLjM0NWYyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/fa6b5478/a89/4chan-voicemail.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/18BQcQg","shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"When 4chan pranksters started bombarding my inbox with spam emails for women's lingerie, I laughed.

But, plenty of innovations help us live more healthily. \n\nIn today's Hangout we'll discuss these things with Derek Flanzraich, founder and CEO of lifestyle site Greatist. \n\nThe following are a few topics we'll be discussing in today's Hangout. \n\nFitness\n\nA digital lifestyle can allow for a flexible schedule and traveling -- which makes those visits to the gym even harder to fit in. For those dedicated to hitting the gym, running outdoors or using the UP by Jawbone wristband to keep track of activity, GymPact helps keep you on track. \n\nWorkouts at home are nothing new, but digital workouts stand out from the VHS or DVDs that domintated the past few decades -- a digital workout can be different each day. Bodbot offers a calendar based on your goals so you do different exercises each day. The scientific 7-minute workout is supposed to replace cardio and weights in less time while only requiring a wall and a chair as props. Zova wants to become the Spotify of workouts and will eventually allow instructors to take its boxing and soccer sets and remix them into new workout playlists. \n\nWhat workouts are best for you when you can't make it to a formal exercise class or the gym?\n\nFood\n\nFor engineers used to programming the tedium out of daily tasks, it was only a matter of time until one of them decided to disrupt food, right? A a Y Combinator alumnus did just that with Soylent, a liquid food replacement that should reduce time and money spent on food while still providing the nutrition your body needs. Some of us find cooking to be and art and eating a celebration, and may not understand the need for such a product, but Soylent's crowdfunding campaign shows it's garnered much enthusiasm.\n\nIf it's not serving a social purpose, should eating a meal be engineered away?\n\nWellness\n\nStanding desks are all the rage, and it's been said that sitting is our generation's cigarettes.

His platform of choice? LiveJournal.\n\nWhile the blogging service is long-pass\u00e9 in the U.S., due to a series of PR flubs and the rise of Facebook and Twitter, LiveJournal has remained an intrinsic part of Russian Internet culture.\n\nIt's so popular, in fact, that LJ (\u0416\u0416 -- pronounced \"Zhe-Zhe\" -- in Russian) has become a proprietary eponym for blogging in general. It's a hub for grassroots reporting of current events in a country where TV is largely controlled by the government. It's a place for political discourse, photos of unlikely subjects and, of course, plenty of cute animals pics.\n\nWhile LiveJournal can't match the speed of Twitter, the reach of Facebook, or the ease of Tumblr, Russian users remained loyal to the outdated blogging platform. Roughly half of LiveJournal's userbase hails from Russia -- an estimated 5.7 million users and 170,000 communities -- and almost all of its operational management takes place now in Moscow.\n\nAs a real, childhood-in-a-snowsuit Russian, I think the appeal lies in LiveJournal's no-frills style. It's remained an unfaltering beacon of the sort of burlap utilitarianism that appeals to a Russian audience. In this case, at least, basic is better.\n\nBut that doesn't mean LiveJournal's audience is satisfied.\n\nSince its 2006 sale to Russian media company SUP Fabrik (part-owned by publishing heavyweight Kommersant), fears of corporate and governmental efforts at stifling dissent on the platform have risen in the oppression-weary nation.\n\n\"The reason (the deal) is so suspicious for us, is that some oligarch is willing to pay so much for something that is not worth so much,\" then-popular LiveJournaler Yaroslav Grekov told Wired at the time. \"That's why I am thinking that Sup's goal is not to earn, but rather to spend money for some very important reason ... the destruction of our LiveJournal community, which is very organized and even dangerous to the government.\"\n\nA recent move by LiveJournal to get rid of its .ru landing page, listed all of the top Russian blogs, further frustrated users already annoyed with the service's history of disregard for its users.\n\n\"The informational-entertaining digest LiveJournal.ru has ceased its existence. New material posted by LiveJournal editors can now be seen in the 'Editors' section,\" LiveJournal announced June 25 on its official Russian-language blog (translation by author).\n\nIn short, while users located in Russia are directed to the same Russian content on a new homepage, those anywhere else are sent to the English version. (Users have developed a workaround: A replica of the previous .ru homepage can be accessed by filtering to Cyrillic.) The move was confusing and disappointing for many users, some of whom expressed their frustration in the comments section of the announcement.\n\nThe change was part of a larger redesign by top Russian Web design studio\u00a0Art. Lebedev, which also did SUP Fabrik-owned news website Gazeta.ru. The change was supposed to a modern update for the community: with bigger fonts and several structural changes. It had the opposite effect: The changes just highlighted how dated the service truly is.\n\nLiveJournal's top Russian users, however, don't seem too concerned. Popular photo blogger Zyalt hasn't said a word about the new look, despite being on a hiatus from his fascinating journeys around the world. Back in March, Zyalt (real name Ilya Varlamov) defended LiveJournal against the previous bout of complaints.\n\nAnd all the while, Navalny has continued to use his popular account to stage demonstrations and rally the masses.\n\nIn the end, that may very well be the reason why most users stick around. So long as popular users like Zyalt and Navalny are contributing original content and commentary in the community, there's a reason to stick around.\n\nWithout a better option that combines simple blogging with a strong community feel, it's likely that LiveJournal will remain Russia's primary blogging platform -- unless, of course, another young idealist like Brad Fitzpatrick builds a brave new platform with free speech, not profit, in mind.\n\nImage: Jason Reed"},"shares":{"twitter":20,"total":20},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzE5L3J1c3NpYWxpdmVqLjkyMTFhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1NngyMDUjCmUJanBn/319bd1a2/635/russia-livejournal.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzE5L3J1c3NpYWxpdmVqLjkyMTFhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTcxMng0MTAjCmUJanBn/063f899a/635/russia-livejournal.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzE5L3J1c3NpYWxpdmVqLjkyMTFhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTI4MHgxNTcjCmUJanBn/87531ba6/635/russia-livejournal.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzE5L3J1c3NpYWxpdmVqLjkyMTFhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTU2MHgzMTQjCmUJanBn/0cde730d/635/russia-livejournal.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/13iBNnQ","shortcode_data":{},"velocity":[42,30,108,409,522,636,660,733,755,831,836,836,866,858,868,862,854,889,916,913,948,977,1000],"channel":"Social Media","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/social-media/"},{"_id":"51f291f4b05f9d2d6e0001af","id":"2013/07/26/huawei-david-cameron-porn-filter","title":"Huawei Operates David Cameron\u2019s Internet Porn Filter","title_tag":null,"author":"Quartz","post_date":"2013-07-26T15:12:39+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 15:12:39 +0000","sort_key":"1v2KFx","link":"http://mashable.com/2013/07/26/huawei-david-cameron-porn-filter/","content":{"plain":"According to the BBC, the filtering system promoted by Britain's prime minister to protect sensitive eyes from the horrors of Internet pornography is run by the controversial Chinese technology company Huawei in partnership with the UK telecoms provider TalkTalk.\n\nDavid Cameron praised TalkTalk on Monday for showing \"great leadership\" in protecting British children's innocence with its HomeSafe service, which allows users to filter adult content. However, he failed to note that Huawei, which is often accused of spying for the Chinese government, partnered with TalkTalk in 2010 to develop the technology, and that Huawei currently operates the filtering software.\n\nHolding up TalkTalk as a model censor, Mr Cameron announced a ban on some of the more unsavory pornographic material on Monday and challenged other Internet service providers to require new subscribers to \"opt in\" to adult content.\n\nHuawei's significant presence in the UK's critical national infrastructure -- it supplies BT -- has concerned some experts because of the concerns about Huawei's ties to the Chinese government.

The company is also working on a device similar to the show's universal translator -- a mythical device on the show that lets everybody speak any language and still be perfectly understood.\n\nHugo Barra, Google's vice president of Android product management, revealed to The Times of London that Google was working on building real-time translation into Android phones. This would mean a person could speak a sentence of phrase into their phone and the person on the other side of the call would hear the words in his native tongue.\n\nSEE ALSO: Beyond Barrel Roll: 10 Hidden Google Tricks\n\nSuch real-time verbal translation has been a staple of science fiction for decades, seen in Star Trek, Doctor Who and, most memorably, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy through the Babel Fish: a tiny fish that anyone can slip in his ear and will absorb speech from its rear fins and project the translation from its mouth.\n\nWe're years away from approaching that level of convenience, according to Google -- but it's in the works. Barra said the prototype phones are \"near perfect\" for specific language pairs such as English to Portuguese.\n\nHowever, the tech is held back by more difficult language pairings (if you've ever used Google Translate for Chinese to English, you know the difficulties) as well as general hardware limitations associated with speech recognition. It's a lot easier for a machine to understand a person in a quiet room, but the translation can get distorted with any background noise.\n\nGoogle isn't the first technology company to make a foray into real-time translation. In 2006, IBM worked with the United States military to create MASTOR, the Multilingual Automatic Speech-to-Speech Translator. IBM equipped 35 laptops with software that would record a user's speech in one language and translate it into Iraqi Arabic after just a few seconds.\n\nHow much would you pay for a real universal translator?

Net income, excluding minority interest, rose 50% to 7.58 trillion, compared with the 8.02 trillion-won average of 24 analyst projections compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSupplying semiconductors and panels for its own devices and those from Apple Inc. and HTC Corp. helps Samsung offset slowing growth in the most-profitable segment of the $358 billion mobile-phone market. The higher capital expenditures come amid stalling demand at its television unit, the world\u2019s biggest, and competition from Chinese brands including Huawei Technologies Co. that sell $100 handsets.\n\n\u201cSamsung is trying to make its profit structure largely balanced,\u201d said Lee Do Hoon, an analyst at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd in Seoul. \u201cSamsung\u2019s smartphone margin may decline in the future but the components businesses, either chips or displays, will become a major profit driver to help it sustain the overall profit.\u201d\n\nSuwon, South Korea-based Samsung will spend a record 24 trillion won on its businesses this year, about 1 trillion won more than last year. Shares of Samsung, which accounts for 18% of the benchmark Kospi index, fell 0.9% to 1,303,000 won today in Seoul.\n\nFalling Prices\n\nThe stock slumped 13% in June, a $26 billion loss of market capitalization that is larger than rival Sony Corp., as analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley lowered their sales and profit estimates.\n\n\u201cThe strong growth streak for the smartphone market is expected to continue in the third quarter albeit at a slower pace,\u201d Samsung said in an e-mailed statement.\n\nThe average price of a smartphone has plunged to $375 from $450 since the beginning of 2012, IDC estimates.\r\nSecond-quarter sales were 57.5 trillion won, compared with a preliminary estimate of about 57 trillion won given by the company July 5. Operating profit, or revenue minus the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses, rose to 9.53 trillion won in the second quarter, compared with the 9.99 trillion-won average of 34 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u2018Increasing Uncertainty\u2019\n\nThe mobile unit, which is responsible for about two-thirds of company earnings, posted operating profit of 6.28 trillion won, up from 4.13 trillion won a year earlier. Samsung, which unveiled the S4 at New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall, said May 23 it sold 10 million units within the first month. The new phone features a 5-inch screen and 13-megapixel camera.\n\nSamsung also worked with rapper Jay-Z to make his new album available via an exclusive app before its official release.\n\n\u201cThe mobile business, the company\u2019s biggest bread earner, has already peaked out in the first quarter,\u201d said Lee Jae Yun, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities Co. in Seoul. \u201cThat is increasing uncertainty over the company\u2019s overall profit growth next year.\u201d\n\nSamsung shipped 76 million smartphones in the quarter, giving it 33.1% of the global market, compared with 31.1% a year earlier, Boston-based Strategy Analytics said today. Apple shipped 31.2 million devices for 13.6% of the market, down from 16.6%, and the Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s lowest share in three years.\n\nNew Note\n\nTongYang Securities Inc. expects Samsung to sell 27 million S4 devices in the third quarter, up from 22 million units delivered in the three months ended June, the brokerage said in a July 9 report.\n\nSamsung is planning to release its Galaxy Note 3 in the second half, is developing a handset using the Tizen operating system and is working on a wristwatch that may perform similar tasks as a smartphone.\n\n\u201cThe Galaxy Note 3 will become the ultimate driver of sales for the company along with its to-be-released \u2018smart watch,\u2019\u201d said Greg Roh, a Seoul-based analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. \u201cThe company must focus more on customizing models and features for the different regions by figuring out their needs.\u201d\n\nApple (AAPL) reported third-quarter profit and sales that beat analysts\u2019 estimates July 23. Though profit shrank in the quarter and iPhone sales fell from a year earlier, the stronger results helped soothe investor concerns that toughening market competition and high-end market saturation would drag Apple into a prolonged slump.\n\nChip Rebound\n\nOperating profit at Samsung\u2019s semiconductor division surged 71% to 1.76 trillion won as chip prices rebounded on sales of mobile devices. Samsung, which supplies more than half the mobile dynamic random-access memory chips used to run smartphones, said in April it may buy the semiconductors from rival SK Hynix Inc. because of surging demand.\n\nOperating profit from the display division, which makes flat panels for TVs and mobile devices, rose 58% to 1.12 trillion won.\r\nThe consumer-electronics unit, which oversees the TV and home-appliance businesses, posted operating profit of 430 billion won, down from 730 billion won a year earlier.\n\nPrices for TVs were slashed as manufacturers struggled to stay profitable amid stalling demand. Samsung had 27.9% of the flat-panel market by revenue, researcher Display Search said in June. The world\u2019s biggest TV maker started selling 55-inch, curved sets using organic light-emitting diode technology for 15 million won in South Korea.\n\n\u201cGrowth will pick up under stronger seasonal demand although competition may intensify with launches of premium TV products,\u201d the company said.\n\nWorldwide shipments of liquid-crystal-display TVs may total 208.8 million units this year, less than the 215.5 million projected earlier, market research firm TrendForce said in a June 13 report.\n\nImage: JUNG YEON-JE/AFP/Getty Images"},"shares":{"twitter":352,"facebook":24,"linked_in":3,"total":379},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzNlL1NhbXN1bmdFYXJuLjFjNGNjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1NngyMDUjCmUJanBn/5cc67a06/c9e/Samsung-Earning.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzNlL1NhbXN1bmdFYXJuLjFjNGNjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTcxMng0MTAjCmUJanBn/ca0bc864/c9e/Samsung-Earning.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzNlL1NhbXN1bmdFYXJuLjFjNGNjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTI4MHgxNTcjCmUJanBn/1af5f348/c9e/Samsung-Earning.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzNlL1NhbXN1bmdFYXJuLjFjNGNjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTU2MHgzMTQjCmUJanBn/bc0aabf8/c9e/Samsung-Earning.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/18H1Lt3","shortcode_data":{},"velocity":[987,982,978,972,968,963,958,952,948,942,938,934,938,932,918,913,908,902,897,891,886,880,865,859,852,846,840,834,828,823,818,814,809,807,804,801,798,794,791,789,786,784,773,770,757,754,751,747,744,740],"channel":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/"},{"_id":"51f27cf612d2cd5b78000c10","id":"2013/07/26/disney-interactive-blank-vinylmation","title":"Disney Interactive Debuts Stop Motion Love Story","title_tag":null,"author":"Adam Popescu","post_date":"2013-07-26T13:43:03+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 13:43:03 +0000","sort_key":"1v2Jql","link":"http://mashable.com/2013/07/26/disney-interactive-blank-vinylmation/","content":{"plain":"When Walt Disney passed away almost 50 years ago, his studio was best known for animated and live action hits such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, Bambi and Treasure Island. \n\nSince then, the brand has ballooned into an empire spanning TV, radio, film, theme parks and toys. This week, a group of filmmaking mouseketeers\u00a0in the Disney Interactive division unveiled a preview of the new original digital series\u00a0Blank: A Vinylmation Love Story, which is based on the popular Vinylmation franchise of collectible figures.\n\nSee also: Disney to Release New 'Star Wars' Film Every Summer Starting in 2015\n\nThe stop motion series follows a lovesick mouse, Blank, in search of his kidnapped paramour Bow. He's on a mission to get her back over the span of 12 episodes, each averaging about three minutes. \n\nBlank is an anomaly. He was born without any facial features, but throughout the series, he discovers the familiar overarching Disney theme that\u00a0it's okay to be different. Like most Disney fare, it's kid-friendly but engaging enough to hold an adult's attention, too.\n\nWatch a preview below:\n\n\"We based this world on Disneyland,\" lead producer Greg Shewchuk told Mashable. \"It's a story about Blank finding his identity.\"\n\nShewchuck said the stop motion technique to make it appear as though physically-manipulated objects moved on their own was painstaking. In total, the shoot went through 20 to 30 different Blanks and Bows; each shot required gluing the toys to the set. Many of the tools used for the show were makeshift; repurposed PVC pipe and hollowed-out Starbucks cups became stage lights. Binder clips held up characters for their close-ups.\n\nThe first three episodes of the series will debut at the D23 Expo on Aug. 11. Subsequent episodes will be released every Saturday throughout mid-October on Disney.com and Disney\u2019s YouTube network.\n\nWhat do you think of the preview above?

What was originally just entertainment generated the next idea for Naughty Dog's blockbuster title The Last of Us.\n\nSee also: 'The Last of Us' Is Raw, Real and Awesome\n\nIn one particular Planet Earth clip, a cordyceps -- a parasitic fungus -- latches onto ants, infecting them and taking control of their brains. The ants lose control of their bodies and go off somewhere to die. Their bodies become hosts to a massive fungal sprout that shoots out of their heads -- once the cordyceps reaches maturity, it sends off spores to infect other creatures nearby.\n\nAs the Planet Earth narrator tells it, there are thousands of types of cordyceps fungi, and each specializes in one host species. So Druckmann wondered, what if it could infect us?\n\nNightmares in Nature\n\nFor those who haven't played, The Last of Us, out last month for PlayStation 3, is an action-adventure game set 20 years after infection wipes out much of the United States population. The infection was a mutated version of cordyceps, able to turn people into shambling, thoughtless monsters out to infect others. In other words, a twist on the classic zombie game.\n\n\"Everything in survival horror games tries to be creepy on every level, but we wanted to add some color and natural beauty to that,\" says Druckmann.\n\nThe team thought about enemies who looked consumed by the fungi. The game's Clickers are the best example; they've spent so long infected by cordyceps that their heads are nothing but colorful fungal masses.\n\n\"If this was grown in nature, you would probably stop to admire it,\" Drunkmann says. \"Instead they are out to kill you. It's a great contradiction to have something so nasty with a gorgeous color palette.\" \n\nDoing Their Homework\n\nDruckmann and Naughty Dog Game Director Bruce Straley agreed a story idea based in truth made a more compelling game. To prepare for The Last of Us, they spent time researching cordyceps and other real parasites. \n\n\"It was all based on the idea that the more numerous a species becomes, the more likely it is to be preyed on by this fungus,\" Drunkmann says. \n\nThe cordyceps isn't the only creepy parasitic predator Druckmann found. He shares a story about a recently discovered wasp in Costa Rica which temporarily paralyzes a spider to lay its eggs on its abdomen. Once those eggs hatch and the larvae is mature, it secretes a chemical that forces the spider to abandon its normal web-building operations, and instead create a cocoon around itself. Once it does that, the spider dies and the larvae consume its body.\n\n\"These infected do the things they know how to do but in a really perverted way. Some of the best horror stories always talk about 'a fate worse than death,'\" Druckmann says. \"Nature is way scarier than anything we could ever imagine.\"\n\nAnother aspect of the Clicker enemies was also inspired by real-world ideas. The enemy gets its name from the clicking sound it makes; the fungal shield has rendered it completely blind, and it uses echolocation to move around and track its prey.\n\nDruckmann says this idea was based on a 20/20 segment he'd seen. In it, a 14-year-old boy blind since birth learned to use echolocation to navigate his world. Apparently, the brain's visual cortex is active even when someone is deprived of sight, so it fills in \"pictures\" through touch and hearing, allowing the blind and visually impaired to get a better sense of place. \n\nDespite their handicap, Clickers are the most ruthless and frightening enemy in the game, and it isn't long before players will associate a far-off clicking with danger ahead.\n\nHumans: Our Own Worst Enemy\n\nOf course, half the foes you encounter in The Last of Us aren't infected by cordyceps. They are the other people left to survive as modern society crumbles, and most are pretty worse for wear.\n\nDruckmann says the team put a lot of thought into how to write the other survivors, desperate people who'd lived for years fighting off infected and other humans. The main characters, Joel and Ellie, encounter several groups of humans along the way, and usually the results don't go so well.\n\nOne of the resources Druckmann studied was the book Polio: An American Story, by David Oshinsky. He learned that as polio ravaged the country in the 1940s and '50s, so did misinformed theories on how the disease spread, including that the lower class transmitted it through unwashed hands. The book also covered different scientists' politically-fueled motivations to complete a vaccine, how they'd perform unethical experiments and test unfinished medicine on their own families in a race to the cure.\n\nHe also says The Last Plague, a book about the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic, was tremendously helpful. One of the most unique flu outbreaks (10-20% of those infected died), the virus killed healthy young adults instead of those with weaker immune systems. The virus hit every corner of the globe, and is responsible for a death toll in the millions.\n\n\"It talked about how towns would basically shut down to avoid spreading infection during that time,\" Druckmann says. \"It makes you really wonder, 'What will I do to survive?'\"\n\nImage: Flickr, ggallice"},"shares":{"linked_in":4,"twitter":563,"google_plus":18,"facebook":104,"stumble_upon":1,"total":690},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzEyL0NvcmR5Y2Vwc2J1LjA4YjNiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1NngyMDUjCmUJanBn/dc0ae656/e0a/Cordyceps-bug.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzEyL0NvcmR5Y2Vwc2J1LjA4YjNiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTcxMng0MTAjCmUJanBn/4b58b544/e0a/Cordyceps-bug.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzEyL0NvcmR5Y2Vwc2J1LjA4YjNiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTI4MHgxNTcjCmUJanBn/4177a7c7/e0a/Cordyceps-bug.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzEyL0NvcmR5Y2Vwc2J1LjA4YjNiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTU2MHgzMTQjCmUJanBn/a4b97925/e0a/Cordyceps-bug.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/13hZUTx","shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-slug":"the-last-of-us-review"}]},"velocity":[816,818,819,820,821,821,822,823,824,825,816,816,806,806,805,804,805,807,800,804,807,811,815,820,824,827,832,835,837,839,841,842,844,844,844,845,846,846,846,846,852,859,876,893,912,932,950,967,983,1000],"channel":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/"}]

The increase was led by Asia-Pacific and Latin America, where display advertising grew 33.2% and 48.2%, respectively. Even in Europe, a comparatively mature market, display grew 10.4%.\n\nSee also: Do Consumers Believe in Advertising?\n\nOne caveat: Nielsen doesn't yet measure search and mobile. The company is still working on ways to accurately track both of those categories. Still, the figures for display are in line with other researchers' reports. The IAB, which looks at advertising trends in the United States, estimated that display advertising grew 9% in 2012. The IAB defines display as encompassing banners, rich media, digital and sponsorships. eMarketer has also predicted that display revenues will eclipse search advertising revenues in the U.S. in 2015. \n\nThe bullish market for display comes despite the fact that banner ads have notoriously low click-through rates. However, executives at Facebook, among others, have argued that CTRs are an outdated, ineffective measure of an ad's success. \n\nInternet advertising may be getting a bigger slice of the overall pie, but according to Nielsen, it's still a pretty paltry slice -- just 4.4%, though that figure would likely more than double if Nielsen had included search. \n\nThe lion's share of media spending still goes to TV (59%) and print (about 30%). TV spending rose 3.5% in the period, leading Nielsen to conclude that \"television remained the dominant media type in terms of advertising investments ... and it appears that TV will maintain this position at least for the short term.\"\n\nImage: Scott Olson, Getty"},"shares":{"facebook":63,"twitter":814,"linked_in":25,"google_plus":12,"total":914},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2Lzk1L0Jhbm5lckFkcy43OWQ5Yy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk2Mzh4MzY4IwplCWpwZw/65cef6f3/31e/Banner-Ads.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2Lzk1L0Jhbm5lckFkcy43OWQ5Yy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxMjc2eDczNiMKZQlqcGc/e2f9067a/31e/Banner-Ads.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2Lzk1L0Jhbm5lckFkcy43OWQ5Yy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkzNTZ4MjA1IwplCWpwZw/4e0ef181/31e/Banner-Ads.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2Lzk1L0Jhbm5lckFkcy43OWQ5Yy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk3MTJ4NDEwIwplCWpwZw/61a334b4/31e/Banner-Ads.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2Lzk1L0Jhbm5lckFkcy43OWQ5Yy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkyODB4MTU3IwplCWpwZw/f7eccaa3/31e/Banner-Ads.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2Lzk1L0Jhbm5lckFkcy43OWQ5Yy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk1NjB4MzE0IwplCWpwZw/8ea169d8/31e/Banner-Ads.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/14QeDL1","shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2013/07/03/infographic-advertising-do-you-buy-it/"}]},"excerpt":"The much-reviled banner ad appears to have some life left.

But now, life-size holograms could eventually be a reality in your own living room.\n\nLos Angeles-based Provision 3D Media is trying to raise $950,000 on Kickstarter to make its hologram technology life-size, as conceptualized in the above image. Right now the company has successfully developed its \"HoloVision\" displays in sizes as small as 3 inches and ranging up to as large as 52 inches. Since the technology is scalable, CEO Curt Thornton told Mashable they've turned to the Kickstarter community to get funds to tool, test and go through the trial-and-error process to get where they achieve a working prototype for a life-size hologram.\n\nSee also: 20 Strange and Hilarious Google Street View Sightings\n\nThornton said the HoloVision technology will be different that other holograms because his company would like to reinvent the light source that produces the image. Instead of using laser technology, he said the company will develop a \"new proprietary light source\" to provide the \"horsepower\" to produce something the size of a human. The specifics of the patented technology and proprietary processes were not detailed. However, a digital file would be put through a proprietary light source, that would be processed and eventually a floating image would be produced.\n\nThornton explained that a project like this is \"the beginning of the manifestation of bringing Hollywood science-fiction to life.\"\n\nLife-size holograms could have uses at retail locations like auto dealerships and furniture stores (to demo large products or serve as virtual greeters), but also could be used in the home, Thornton said. It could even be applied to gaming, he explained.\n\n\"There's a very large community of gamers out there -- whether it's an Xbox, PlayStation, Wii or even PC gamers -- that love to have virtual environments and are immersed in that environment,\" Thornton said.\n\nOnce Provision 3D Media gets a life-size prototype working, the company plans on revealing the technology at a Los Angeles event, followed by a road show to other cities like San Francisco, New York, Austin and Chicago. Later this year, the company is integrating its smaller holographic displays at RiteAid stores, so customers can access wellness information, as well as promotional content, product samples, rewards and coupons. Thornton characterizes this retail use case as disruptive technology to capture eyeballs of people in a store (as shown in a convenience store below).\n\nIn the future, Thornton said his company hopes this holographic technology will be accessible to all: \"... Not only just the science-fiction buffs and the technology geeks of the world, but the everyday person that really just wants to have that next-generation experience.\"\n\nBackers of Provision 3D Media's Kickstarter project can get a static analog, three-inch HoloVision device (shown below) for pledges of $299 (limited) or $349. For a pricier $7,500 pledge, backers can get the digital HoloVision device -- but only a 17-inch version. With still 19 days left to go in the Kickstarter campaign, backers had pledged a bit over $11,000 out of the $950,000 goal.\n\nWhat do you think about life-size holograms?

Surf from cat video to amateur vlog to high-quality episodic show in just a few clicks, all under one network.\n\nOf course, with billions of hours of video available to chose from, how does one go about tailoring his interests and finding the people who create that great stuff? While extensive YouTube searches can help fix your bike or tie a Windsor knot, a television-like experience that offers a stream of entertaining content requires more work.\n\nSee also: For Anybody Hurting: A YouTube Video Confronts Darkness\n\nIf you arrive at the YouTube's homepage with no clear search goals in mind, it can be difficult to discover something new. The best way around this? Subscribe to several channels and find great YouTubers. But if you're struggling to start, Mashable will guide you to finding quality video creators, no matter what your tastes.\n\nStart With the Big Names\n\nYouTube has its celebrity set -- if you are a frequent reader of Mashable, you probably know some of them -- and they are a good place to start. You can check out the 100 most subscribed channels to get an idea of what's popular on YouTube. The most popular stuff seems to fall under a few categories: comedy, gaming, style and music videos, with strong showings by a few brands and publications.\n\nIf you don't see any from a category that interests you, check out our guides for standout YouTube channels for home improvement, fitness, sketch comedy, travel, beauty and cooking.\n\nOnce you've found a few you like, check out the sidebar on each channel page. It features channels that user has recommended or subscribed to. You'll find great suggestions there. \n\nYouTube is a solid community first, and most video creators interact with each other through comments, likes, subscriptions and even video shout-outs. \n\nIf you want to get even more granular in the YouTube community, your \"My Subscriptions\" tab on the left side comes in two categories: \"Uploads Only\" and \"All Activity.\" The first shows you the new videos that channel has uploaded, but the \"All Activity\" tab displays all the comments, likes and new subscriptions from every YouTube channel you follow. Is this overwhelming? Yes, but it's a great place to find channels and videos you've never seen before.\n\nGet Social\n\nAside from useful ways to find content within YouTube's walls, you may also have to explore other social networks to find content you're interested in. \n\nIf you're already plugged into Twitter, finding your favorite YouTube channels there will ensure you not only stay updated, but also follow who they retweet and share content from. If you're hooked into Google+, you can see videos your friends share from the \"Social\" tab on the left side of the page.\n\nThere are also a few great YouTube-focused blogs that highlight up-and-comers, including New Media Rockstars and TubeFilter. \n\nPlus, check out the very active r/YouTube subreddit, where creators share videos and talk tips for maintaining their channels.\n\nWatch, Share and Interact\n\nUnfortunately, there is no quick fix for finding great YouTube content at the moment, so you'll have to get your hands dirty and dive in. \n\nBecause YouTube is so social, inevitably, watching videos will surface new YouTubers. Plenty of personalities guest star on each other's channels, across all kinds of interests, and videos can sometimes daisy-chain off each other. Plus, the web produces an infinite number of trends; YouTubers are bound to respond. Take the biographical video trend \"Draw My Life.\" Once you discover a popular video topic, you'll find other participants.  \n\nThe best thing to do is start exploring -- there's no wrong way. And don't get discouraged by all the content. While there might be a lot of crap on YouTube, you'll find the best, most relevant stuff by staying active.\n\nWhat are some of your tips for finding new YouTube channels? Please share them in the comments.\n\nImage: iStockphoto, tomispin"},"shares":{"twitter":977,"facebook":91,"google_plus":17,"linked_in":22,"pinterest":5,"stumble_upon":3,"total":1115},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2L2Y2L3lvdXR1YmVjaGFuLjI4MDFlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTYzOHgzNjgjCmUJanBn/e5715f02/9d1/youtube-channel-searching.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2L2Y2L3lvdXR1YmVjaGFuLjI4MDFlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyNzZ4NzM2IwplCWpwZw/8538bb51/9d1/youtube-channel-searching.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2L2Y2L3lvdXR1YmVjaGFuLjI4MDFlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1NngyMDUjCmUJanBn/dc611bb7/9d1/youtube-channel-searching.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2L2Y2L3lvdXR1YmVjaGFuLjI4MDFlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTcxMng0MTAjCmUJanBn/c1dd9eec/9d1/youtube-channel-searching.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2L2Y2L3lvdXR1YmVjaGFuLjI4MDFlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTI4MHgxNTcjCmUJanBn/40d95b49/9d1/youtube-channel-searching.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2L2Y2L3lvdXR1YmVjaGFuLjI4MDFlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTU2MHgzMTQjCmUJanBn/8044d1c1/9d1/youtube-channel-searching.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/14dL6Ey","shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2013/06/18/for-anybody-hurting/"}]},"excerpt":"YouTube is pretty incredible.

This shouldn't come as a surprise, though; Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said early and often that monetizing the microblogging platform \"in a way that's meaningful and additive to the user experience\" would be a priority.\n\nWhen Mayer made these announcements, she couldn't have known exactly what she'd be getting in the way of campaigns. And yet, some brands have spent the past few months producing initiatives that fit her description well. Not only are they meaningful in the sense that they provide value to the user - whether in the form of visual interest or informational content - but they also enhance the Tumblr experience. Brands are creating pages, photos and animated GIFs that are worth reblogging and that users are happy to share -- despite the fact that they bear the mark of the \"sponsored post\" dollar sign.\n\nPicture the Trip of Your Dreams\r\nTo promote its Venture Card, Capital One is tapping into users' wanderlust and creating image-based content -- something brands are finding great success with on the platform. Studies show that the majority of Tumblr posts include photographs, and that photos get the most notes (including reblogs). In the case of the Venture Bucket List Tumblr, Capital One is asking users to post their travel dreams. It then tasks artists and illustrators with turning those dream destinations into static and animated GIFs.\n\nImage: Capital One/Tumblr\n\nThe brand endorses the use of the #BucketList hashtag to encourage additional conversation on Facebook and Twitter. In their company-generated posts, Capitol One emphasizes the fact that the Venture Card can help consumers build up the miles they need to see Machu Picchu or travel throughout Eastern Europe (\"So go ahead, Czech that off your #BucketList!\"). Those who choose to follow the page are frequently treated to new consumer-inspired imagery to help them keep their travel dreams alive.\n\nShow Character\r\nWhen The Art Institute of Chicago revealed a new exhibit last month called \"Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity,\" which combines fashions from the 1800s with famous works of Impressionist art, it drummed up added interest with a unique character-driven Tumblr page. Following the exploits of fictional 19th-century Parisian Jean-Paul Brunier as he explores 21st-century Chicago, the blog features photographs of artwork on display at the museum alongside pictures of stylish modern-day Chicagoans.\n\nImage: Art Institute of Chicago/Tumblr\n\nWhen the page first launched, it wasn't entirely clear whether the Art Institute was behind it, and that added to the intrigue. Now the Art Institute is using Twitter to drive traffic as well -- maintaining a character account with tweets written in the voice of Monsieur Brunier, as well as emailing video postcards that feature information about the exhibit's artists. As a means of providing interesting themed content and generating buzz among fashion-conscious social media users, the cross-era fashion blogger concept is clever as can be. Followers of the Impressions & Fashion page might even see themselves featured online.\n\nMake a Scene\r\nThe comedy website CollegeHumor launched its first original feature film with a Tumblr campaign that leveraged the power of the animated GIF. Called Coffee Town, the movie was promoted on the Tumblr-based CollegeHumor Staff Blog with a page skin, while the GIF appeared both on the blog and as an ad on Tumblr users' dashboards.\n\nImage: CollegeHumor/Tumblr\n\nWhat's different about this campaign is the GIF content: It rotated the promotional poster with a selection of scenes from the film. This approach gave viewers a sneak peek, trailer-style, while also ensuring they'd recognize and recall the visual content used for branding across the web -- a critical point for a movie distributed primarily through digital channels.\n\nThe success of Tumblr campaigns depends on the ability of brand marketers to make their ads and blogs as interesting as the user-generated content they'll ultimately sit alongside. Take a tip from Marissa Mayer and aim for meaningful. Only then will your campaigns resonate with users.\n\nMashable composite.

Although some might say weather and calamities are unpredictable, it doesn't hurt to be prepared. Thankfully, various groups and agencies have made apps geared towards disaster relief and preparedness. Here, we highlight six that could help you prepare for the worst.\n\n1. Project NOAH\n\nImage: Project Noah, Department of Science and Technology\n\nProject NOAH (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards) is the official mobile application of the Philippines' Department of Science and Technology's (DOST) website of the same name. The app provides a lot of useful tools and information such as weather news and flood forecasting and warning. It also provides a map view of the Philippine \"Area of Responsibility\" (PAR), rainfall contours, chance of rain, radar images (for Subic, Tagaytay, Cebu, Hinatuan, Tampakan), sensors and typhoon forecasts. Screenshots and information from the app can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail and even via Bluetooth.\n\n2. Flood Patrol\n\nImage: Flood Patrol, Ateneo Java Wireless Competency Center\n\nThe Ateneo Java Wireless Competency Center's (AJWCC) Flood Patrol works in harmony with the aforementioned Project Noah for flood monitoring and mapping in the Philippines. Not only does it give people a visual map of flood reports in a certain area, but it also allows them to send flood reports to NOAH to help with the site's flood mapping. These reports are also help pinpoint which areas need immediate rescue and evacuation.\n\n3. Water4Thai\n\nImage: Water4Thai\n\nWater4Thai is an app that aims to keep people in Thailand informed and ready in the event of flood disasters. It provides important information such as weather and rainfall data from the national Department of Meteorology, and includes stats on water levels in rivers and dams from the Royal Irrigation Department. The app presents information via charts, graphs and lists that can be accessed in both Thai and English.\n\n4. Tsunami Tracker\n\nImage: Tsunami Tracker\n\nThe world was in shock after the South Asian tsunami in 2004, and again after a massive tsunami swept across Japan in 2011. Since those disasters, there has been a greater call for preparedness as well as information regarding earthquakes and possible tsunamis. Tsunami Tracker not only contains warnings for tsunamis and earthquakes directly from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminsitration (NOAA), but also allows fast emergency calls to emergency numbers in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n5. Disaster Alert\n\nImage: Disaster Alert\n\nTrue to its name, Disaster Alert covers lists and maps of disaster risks across the globe.\"Active hazards\" are incidents that are deemed hazardous by the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and are recorded and listed by the app in real-time. Among the active hazards are common natural disasters in Asia such as tropical cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis and floods.\n\n6. ubAlert \u2013 Disaster Alert Network\n\nImage: ubAlert\n\nUnlike most disaster apps, ubAlert not only collects information from organizations and websites, but also from its users. Information is presented as graphs, lists, charts, maps, images and videos, and may be shared via email, Facebook and Twitter. Another unique feature is that it does't just cover natural disasters, but also other calamities such as terrorist attacks and pandemic virus outbreaks. As soon as it receives an event from one of its users, the information will be validated from a reliable source or organization. As soon as it is recognized as a potential threat, all users that may be affected within the impact area will be alerted so to reduce casualties and/or deaths.\n\nImage: Museum Syndicate/Wikimedia Commons"},"shares":{"twitter":828,"facebook":168,"linked_in":10,"stumble_upon":1,"total":1007},"comments_count":0,"responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzBmL2dyZWF0d2F2ZW9mLmFiNWU2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTYzOHgzNjgjCmUJanBn/fc98c438/8b2/great-wave-off-kanagawaa.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzBmL2dyZWF0d2F2ZW9mLmFiNWU2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyNzZ4NzM2IwplCWpwZw/9b7ccc51/8b2/great-wave-off-kanagawaa.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzBmL2dyZWF0d2F2ZW9mLmFiNWU2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1NngyMDUjCmUJanBn/0fbcd27c/8b2/great-wave-off-kanagawaa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzBmL2dyZWF0d2F2ZW9mLmFiNWU2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTcxMng0MTAjCmUJanBn/73bb4c36/8b2/great-wave-off-kanagawaa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzBmL2dyZWF0d2F2ZW9mLmFiNWU2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTI4MHgxNTcjCmUJanBn/c383c176/8b2/great-wave-off-kanagawaa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA3LzI2LzBmL2dyZWF0d2F2ZW9mLmFiNWU2LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTU2MHgzMTQjCmUJanBn/de7fa7ca/8b2/great-wave-off-kanagawaa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/147bXcD","shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Asia has experienced its share of devastating natural disasters: earthquakes, tsunamis, storms and floods.
